### Reflections and comments

12/11/2020 added some styles to css, a few changes to the form and its function, and adjusted some of the code in app.js.

12/10/2020 adding form to sales.html. Adding the data to the bottom of the table and reseting the footer to include all the totals correctly.

12/9/2020 finished the footer section of the table and adjusted some bugs in my js logic thanks to Seamus. Created the structure and css for index.html and sales.html

12/8/2020 Created objects for each store and populated the a table with the data that was generated from the previous lab.

12/7/2020 Project started: created sales.html, index.html, style.css, and app.js. In app.js create objects for each store location of populated the lists with the given sales data using various functions and for loops.
